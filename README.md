TODO:
Develop some GUI enabling users to draw their own maps as opposed to program creating them randomly; the graph coloring algorithm could be upgraded to color them rather easily. There is a challenge here however, which boils down to making sure that users input  only maps that correspond to planar graphs exclusively, which in turn are the only graph types that are suitable for applying coloring algorithms based on the four color theorem (see wiki's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem). A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without crossings by placing each vertex at an arbitrarily chosen location within the region to which it belongs, and by drawing the edges as curves without crossings that lead from one region's vertex, across a shared boundary segment, to an adjacent region's vertex.
